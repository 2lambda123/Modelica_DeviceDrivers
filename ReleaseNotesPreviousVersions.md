# Release Notes of Previous Versions

Notice that bug fix releases usually do not have release notes.

*  [Version v1.6.0 (2018-10-06)](../../releases/tag/v1.6.0)
   * Support for MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport protocol) client communication (see #130, #256).
   * Utility function to retrieve MAC address (`Utilities.Functions.getMACAddress`, see #255).
   * Utility function to generate a UUID (`Utilities.Functions.generateUUID()`, see #244).
   * Number of received bytes in `UDPReceive` block is provided as output (see #236).
   * Scalable real-time synchronization (see #215).
   * Adaption of the new Modelica Association license for libraries:
     [The 3-Clause BSD License](https://modelica.org/licenses/modelica-3-clause-bsd) (see #238, #264).
     The C-code parts of the library were already BSD 3-Clause licensed, but the Modelica code was licensed
     under the Modelica License 2. Since Modelica Association projects, most notably the Modelica Standard Library (MSL),
     changed from Modelica License 2 to the BSD 3-Clause license, the Modelica_DeviceDrivers library follows this development.
   * Other (minor) fixes and improvements.
*  [Version v1.5.1 (2017-09-19)](../../releases/tag/v1.5.1)
    * Bug fix for variable name spelling error in `Blocks.InputDevices.JoystickInput` (#224)
*  [Version v1.5.0 (2017-05-12)](../../releases/tag/v1.5.0)
    * **Important**: A bug fix in the shared memory implementation for *Windows* potentially affects applications that adapted the (wrong) buffer layout (see #138)!
    * Presentation of the library at the [Modelica'2017 conference](https://www.modelica.org/events/modelica2017).
    * OpenModelica (v1.11.0 Beta 1 and later) is now the third tool known to (partially) support the library (e.g., UDP, TCP/IP, serial port, shared memory, and LCM communication).
    * Added support for sending and receiving of Lightweight Communications and Marshalling [LCM](https://lcm-proj.github.io) datagrams (only the communication aspect of LCM is considered).
    * Added support for TCP/IP communication for Linux (was already available for Windows).
    * New top-level package `EmbeddedTargets` with a first prototypical support for the Atmel AVR family of microcontrollers (ATmega16 and ATmega328P (=Arduino Uno) are supported; currently only known to work with OpenModelica's ExperimentalEmbeddedC code generation, see documentation).
    * Bug fixes for the serial port support (#117, #118, #119, #127, #128).
    * Bug fix for the byte order swapping logic (endianness, #203).
    * Other (minor) fixes and improvements.
*  [Version v1.4.4 (2016-04-12)](../../releases/tag/v1.4.4)
    * Bug fix release, no new features, but many improvements since version v1.4.0 (more than 70 commits since v1.4.0), so let's list some of the improvements...
    * Uses latest version of Modelica Standard Library (v3.2.2).
    * Changed the license of the external C code and header files to [Simplified BSD License](Modelica_DeviceDrivers/Resources/License.txt) (the Modelica package parts remain under [Modelica License 2](https://modelica.org/licenses/ModelicaLicense2)).
    * Improved Modelica compatibility: Fixed the use of conditionally enabled variable `procPrio` outside of connect in `Blocks.OperatingSystem.SynchronizeRealtime` and `ClockedBlocks.OperatingSystem.SynchronizeRealtime`.
    * Improved Modelica compatibility: Fixed the invalid integer to enumeration type conversion in `HardwareIO`.
    * Fully specified the initial conditions for example models.
    * Simplified the linking with system libraries (MSVC only).
    * Added continuous integration for the external C code (thanks to [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/modelica-3rdparty/Modelica_DeviceDrivers)).
    * Improved and updated documentation.
    * Improved compatibility with the DLR Visualization Library.
    * Improved support of automatic Code-Export from SimulationX 3.7.
    * Fixes for the clocked communication blocks (added missing `byteOrder` support).
    * Other (minor) fixes.
*  [Version v1.4.0 (2015-09-01)](../../releases/tag/v1.4.0)
    * Switched to [semantic versioning](http://semver.org).
    * Migrated to new release process motivated by [impact-on-library-developers](https://github.com/xogeny/impact/blob/master/resources/docs/modelica2015/paper/impact.md#impact-on-librarydevelopers).
    * Added support for external trigger signals to trigger communication blocks.
    * Added support to configure byte ordering in communication blocks.
    * Added support for TCP/IP communication for Windows.
    * Added serial port support for Windows (was already available for Linux).
    * Added compiler support for MinGW and Cygwin.
    * Added support for all 32 joystick buttons.
    * Fixed Modelica compatibility of output buffers in communication blocks.
    * Fixed multi-threaded access of UDP and shared memory communication for Windows.
    * Fixed many small issues, particularly for improved compatibility with SimulationX.
*  [Version v1.3 (2014-05-19)](../../archive/v1.3+build.2.zip)
    * Fixed many issues in order to support SimulationX (with the indispensable help of [Thomas Beutlich](https://github.com/beutlich)).
    * Particularly, a SimulationX compatible wrapper DLL to give access to the external C functions was added.
    * Added serial port support for Linux.
*  [Version v1.2 (2013-10-01)](../../archive/v1.2+build.1.zip)
    * Adapted to the conventions of the Modelica Standard Library 3.2.1 and Modelica_Synchronous 0.92.
    * Added utility functions to load parameters from a file.
*  [Version v1.1 (2013-04-24)](../../archive/v1.1build4.zip)
    * Latest build (2013-09-20) uses latest Modelica Standard Library version 3.2.1 and Modelica_Synchronous version 0.92, but will also work with previous versions 3.2 and 0.91.
    * Improved Modelica 3.3 standard conformance (hopefully completely standard conform by now)
    * Included support for the Linux Controller Area Network Protocol Family (aka Socket CAN). This is considered an alpha feature. Therefore the API is not stable and testing has been very limited
    * The CMake based build system for the external C sources of this library has been improved to be more robust and better documented.
    * Bugs in the SerialPackager's AddString and GetString blocks have been resolved and new blocks AddFloat and GetFloat are now available.
    * Some smaller additional bug fixes and improvements.
*  [Version v1.0 (2012-10-17)](../../archive/v1.0.zip)
    * Initial release `v1.0_build5` with improved documentation
